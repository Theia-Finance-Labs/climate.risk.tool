)
}
\arguments{
\item{companies}{tibble with company data including NPV and debt information}

\item{company_yearly_trajectories}{tibble with columns: company, year, scenario, total_revenue, total_profit, total_discounted_profit, total_discounted_net_profit}

\item{assets_discounted_yearly}{tibble with yearly asset data for asset-level results}

\item{discount_rate}{numeric. Discount rate (used for consistency, but discounting already applied)}
}
\value{
tibble with company financial results
}
\description{
Takes yearly company trajectories and computes final company-level
NPV, PD, and Expected Loss metrics. Aggregates yearly data and applies risk models.
