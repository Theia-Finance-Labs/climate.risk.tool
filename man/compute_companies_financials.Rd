\usage{
compute_companies_financials(
  company_yearly_trajectories,
  assets_discounted_yearly,
  discount_rate = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{company_yearly_trajectories}{data.frame with columns: company, year, scenario, total_revenue, total_profit, total_discounted_profit, total_discounted_net_profit}

\item{assets_discounted_yearly}{data.frame with yearly asset data for asset-level results}

\item{discount_rate}{numeric. Discount rate (used for consistency, but discounting already applied)}
}
\value{
list(assets = data.frame, companies = data.frame)
}
\description{
Takes yearly company trajectories and computes final company-level
NPV, PD, and Expected Loss metrics. Aggregates yearly data and applies risk models.
This is the main function for company-level financial analysis.
}
\details{
Compute company-level financial results from yearly trajectories
