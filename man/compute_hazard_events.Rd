\title{Prepare assets with geospatial hazard data and damage cost factors}
\usage{
compute_hazard_events(assets, hazards, areas, damage_factors)
}
\arguments{
\item{assets}{data.frame of assets (as read by read_assets())}

\item{hazards}{named list of SpatRaster from load_hazards()}

\item{areas}{list with municipalities and provinces used by geolocate_assets()}

\item{damage_factors}{data.frame with damage and cost factors lookup table}
}
\value{
data.frame with assets enriched with geospatial hazard data and damage/cost factors
}
\description{
Performs geospatial operations to prepare assets for event processing:
geolocates assets, cuts out hazards, summarizes hazards in long format, and joins
damage cost factors. This isolates the geospatial processing from event-specific logic.
}
