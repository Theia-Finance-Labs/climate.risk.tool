\title{Apply Chronic Revenue Shock (Placeholder)}
\usage{
apply_chronic_revenue_shock(
  yearly_trajectories,
  assets_factors,
  chronic_events
)
}
\arguments{
\item{yearly_trajectories}{data.frame with columns: asset, company, year, baseline_revenue (or shocked_revenue if already processed)}

\item{assets_factors}{data.frame with hazard data and damage factors (currently unused)}

\item{chronic_events}{data.frame with chronic event information (currently unused)}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns: asset, company, year, shocked_revenue
}
\description{
Placeholder function that passes through baseline revenue as shocked revenue.
This is a temporary implementation that maintains the expected output structure
while the actual shock calculation logic is being developed. NOTE: This function
only affects REVENUE. Profit is computed separately using compute_profits_from_revenue().
