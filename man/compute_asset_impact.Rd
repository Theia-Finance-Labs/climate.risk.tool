\title{Compute Asset Impact}
\usage{
compute_asset_impact(assets_with_shocks)
}
\arguments{
\item{assets_with_shocks}{data.frame. Asset data with damage factors, acute_shock, and chronic_shock columns}
}
\value{
data.frame with updated share_of_economic_activity and working columns removed
}
\description{
Computes the total climate impact on each asset by combining damage factors,
acute shocks, and chronic shocks. Updates the share_of_economic_activity to reflect
reduced economic productivity due to climate impacts. Removes all working columns
to prepare for scenario analysis.
}
\details{
Compute Asset Impact

Calculates the final climate impact on assets by updating share of economic activity
and removing working columns. This is the final step before scenario building.
