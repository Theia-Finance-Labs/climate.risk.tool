\title{Apply Acute Shock to Yearly Profit (Placeholder)}
\usage{
apply_acute_profit_shock(yearly_trajectories, assets_factors, acute_events)
}
\arguments{
\item{yearly_trajectories}{data.frame with columns: asset, company, year, shocked_revenue, shocked_profit}

\item{assets_factors}{data.frame with hazard data and cost factors (currently unused)}

\item{acute_events}{data.frame with acute event information (currently unused)}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns: asset, company, year, shocked_revenue, shocked_profit
}
\description{
Placeholder function that passes through profit values unchanged.
This is a temporary implementation that maintains the expected output structure
while the actual shock calculation logic is being developed. Unlike revenue shocks,
profit shocks may involve fixed costs or operational disruptions that aren't
proportional to revenue impacts.
