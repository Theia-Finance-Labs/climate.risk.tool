\title{Map hazard intensity to damage and cost factors}
\usage{
join_damage_cost_factors(assets_with_hazard_means, factors_csv_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{assets_with_hazard_means}{Data frame with asset information including hazard mean columns}

\item{factors_csv_path}{Path to CSV file containing damage and cost factors}
}
\value{
Data frame with original columns plus damage_factor and cost_factor columns
}
\description{
Joins assets with damage and cost factors from a lookup table based on
rounded hazard intensity values and asset category. Hazard intensity is rounded
to the nearest integer for matching.
}
\details{
Join damage and cost factors based on hazard intensity and asset category
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
base_dir <- system.file("tests_data", package = "climate.risk.tool")
assets <- read_inputs(base_dir)$assets
assets$hazard_dummy <- 12.4
factors_path <- file.path(base_dir, "damage_and_cost_factors.csv")
assets_with_factors <- join_damage_cost_factors(assets, factors_path)
}
