\usage{
compute_asset_revenue(assets_scenarios, companies, growth_rate = 0.03)
}
\arguments{
\item{assets_scenarios}{data.frame. Asset data with scenario column (from build_scenarios)}

\item{companies}{data.frame. Company data with company_name and revenues columns}

\item{growth_rate}{numeric. Growth rate to apply to company revenues (default 0.03)}
}
\value{
data.frame with all original columns plus 'asset_revenue' column
}
\description{
Joins asset data with company data and computes asset-level revenue.
Revenue is allocated to each asset based on:
company_revenue * (1 + growth_rate) * asset_share_of_economic_activity
}
\details{

\examples{
\dontrun{
assets <- data.frame(company = "A", scenario = "baseline", 
                    share_of_economic_activity = 0.5)
companies <- data.frame(company_name = "A", revenues = 1000)
result <- compute_asset_revenue(assets, companies, growth_rate = 0.05)
}
