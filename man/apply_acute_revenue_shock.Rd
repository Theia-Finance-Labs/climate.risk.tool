\title{Apply Acute Revenue Shock}
\usage{
apply_acute_revenue_shock(yearly_trajectories, assets_factors, acute_events)
}
\arguments{
\item{yearly_trajectories}{tibble with columns: asset, company, year, revenue}

\item{assets_factors}{tibble with hazard data and damage factors including event_id, hazard_type}

\item{acute_events}{tibble with acute event information including event_id, hazard_type, event_year}
}
\value{
tibble with columns: asset, company, year, revenue (with shocks applied)
}
\description{
Applies revenue shocks from acute climate events in event_id order.
Supports FloodTIF (business disruption), Compound/heat (labor productivity loss via Cobb-Douglas),
and Drought (crop damage for agriculture). Multiple shocks in the same year are applied sequentially by event_id.
NOTE: This function only affects REVENUE. Profit is computed separately using compute_profits_from_revenue().
