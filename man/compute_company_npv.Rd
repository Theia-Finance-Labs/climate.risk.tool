\title{Compute Company NPV from Yearly Data}
\usage{
compute_company_npv(yearly_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{yearly_data}{data.frame. Either company yearly trajectories or asset yearly data with discounted profit columns}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns: company, scenario, npv
}
\description{
Aggregates yearly discounted net profits from company trajectories to compute company-level NPV.
Can work with either company yearly trajectories or asset yearly data.
Groups by company and scenario, summing discounted_net_profit or total_discounted_net_profit values across years.
}
\details{
Compute Company NPV from Yearly Trajectories

Aggregates yearly company trajectories to company-level NPV by scenario.
Computes Net Present Value (NPV) for each company in each scenario by summing yearly discounted profits.

# With company yearly data
