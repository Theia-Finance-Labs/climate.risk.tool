## Frontend/UI TDD Exception

For all changes scoped to the app frontend and UI layer, the strict TDD-first rules do not apply. You may implement UI changes directly without first writing tests.

This exception applies to:
- `inst/app/**` and `inst/app/www/**` (static assets: CSS, JS, images, html templates)
- `R/app_ui.R` (top-level UI composition)
- `R/mod_*.R` changes limited to UI construction (`mod_*_ui()`), layout, inputs/outputs declarations, htmlwidgets, and visual-only refactors
- `inst/golem-config.yml` UI-only configuration tweaks

Constraints and clarifications:
- Do NOT use this exception for server logic, reactivity, or data/business logic inside `R/mod_*.R` (e.g., `mod_*_server()`): TDD-first still applies there.
- If a change spans both UI and server logic, split the edits: UI parts may proceed without tests; server parts must follow TDD-first.
- Keep documentation practices: update `CONTEXT.md` for notable UI changes and run `devtools::document()` when roxygen docs are impacted.
- NAMESPACE/DESCRIPTION policies remain unchanged.

Examples covered by this exception:
- Adding/changing inputs, outputs, layout, CSS classes, icons, or HTML structure in `mod_*_ui()`
- Styling updates in `inst/app/www/custom.css` and other static assets
- Adjusting top-level UI composition in `app_ui()`

Examples NOT covered (TDD required):
- Any changes in `mod_*_server()` or other server-side functions
- Data transformations, validations, or computations, even if triggered by UI
- Inter-module communication logic beyond simple wiring of UI elements

Rationale:
- UI work benefits from rapid iteration; enforcing TDD on visual changes can slow delivery without improving reliability proportionally. This rule enables faster frontend iteration while preserving TDD rigor for server/business logic.
